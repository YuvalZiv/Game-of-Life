# Game of Life
This project is an implementation of game of life in C Programming Language. If you are not familiar with game of life, please read more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

## Getting Started
You can download the entire project, and you'll have a full C project, which you can run on VS.
Another option is to download the executable of this code from Game of Life\Debug\Game of Life.exe

### Prerequisites
If you download the full project, you need a C compiler.
I suggest using Visual Studio [Youtube Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuR-54fQrA0)
Otherwise, using the executable, you only need a way to run .exe files.

## Running the code
When running this code, you won't need to enter any arguments.
It will run automatically and you control every generation.
Use ```Game of Life.exe``` to run the code.
Every time you want to run the next generation, press enter.
If you want to quit, press Escape.
The 'Game' will end whenever there is no more living cells.
